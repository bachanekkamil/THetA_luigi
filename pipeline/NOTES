This directory contains pipeline scripts for running BAM files through 
various programs. The two main scripts are:

processBAMPair.bash 
DESC: Runs programs on a single pair of BAM Files 
USAGE: processBAMPair.bash config bamTumor bamNormal ID
PARAMS:
	config - Config file specifies which programs will be run, as well as the
			 output location and the locations of some reference files 
			 (e.g. the reference genome). A sample config file is located in 
			 the configs directory named "configShell.txt". 
	bamTumor - /the/path/to/TUMOR.bam
	bamNormal - /the/path/to/NORMAL.bam
	ID - The ID is what the directory containing output files will be named

processBatchBAM.py
DESC: Runs processBAMPair.bash on a list of BAM pairs				
USAGE: processBatchBAM.sh BAMList config
PARAMS: 
	BAMList - List of BAM pairs. For each pair, there should be 3 lines, in the
			order bamTumor, bamNormal, ID
	config - File as describled in processBAMPair.bash

Additional helper script:
createBAMList.py
DESC: Creates BAMList file in the format expected by processBatchBAM.sh
USAGE: createBAMList.sh DIR
PARAMS: DIR - base directory, structure described in greater
	 detail in createBAMList.py 

All program scripts should be in scripts directory.

# 12/17/2013 - Gryte
Added scripts to pair up BAM files based on analysisID

In order to be able to run files, use the following technique:
$DATA - location of data directory (i.e. /tmp/links/data/)

ls $DATA > anIDs.txt
python AnalysisIDtoTCGA.py anIDs.txt ../reference/WGSMetadata > barcode.txt
python PairBAMFiles.py barcode.txt > batchInput.txt
rm anIDs.txt barcode.txt

AnalysisIDtoTCGA.py 
DESC: Given a list of analysis IDS, returns the matching TCGA Bar codes
USAGE: AnalysisIDtoTCGA.py AnalysisIDFile XMLFile
PARAMS: AnalysisIDFile: List of analysis IDs
	XMLFile: Metadata XML file from cgquery


PairBAMFiles.py
DESC: Given a list of IDs, a directory containing the files and their barcode,
	pairs up files returns them in the format accepted by processBatchBAM.py
USAGE: PairBAMFiles.py BarcodeFile (prefix)
PARAMS: BarcodeFile: File containing lines with the analysisID and bar code
			tab separted (output of AnalysisIDtoTCGA.py)
